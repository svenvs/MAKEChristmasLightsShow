# MAKEChristmasLightsShow

Hi and welcome to the MAKE session where we are going to create a crazy light show!

Before we start I want to make sure you have the folowing things with you:

* Your wifi ssid
* Your wifi pass
* The NODE MCU/ wemos (ESP 8266)
* Jumper cables
* LED strips

All connections working? Great lets move on!
